Assignment-3 on Numpy, Pandas &amp; Matplotlib

#1) Numpy:
a.)	For task a) I have used ‘randint’ method to generate random integers and then have arranged in a required shape using ‘shape’ method. And to find max in each row I have used         ‘amax’ method, later replaced the max value with 0.                                                                                                                         
    To create 2D array composed of 4-byte integer elements, I have used ‘int32’ method from numpy.

b.) For task b) I have used ‘linalg’ method in which we have ‘eig’ method which will give eigenvalues & eigen vector

c.) For task c) I have used ‘trace’ method from numpy to retrieve the sum of the diagonal element of a given array.

d.) For task d) we have used ‘reshape’ method with required parameters to reshape the array without changing its data.

#2) Matplotlib:
   For plotting a graph, I have first defined the given array for popularity & programming language. Later we used ‘matplotlib.pyplot’  library to plot the given diagram.
